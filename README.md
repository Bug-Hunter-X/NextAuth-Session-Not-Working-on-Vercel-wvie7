# NextAuth Session Issue on Vercel

This repository demonstrates a problem encountered when deploying a Next.js application with NextAuth.js to Vercel. Locally, the API route correctly retrieves the session, but after deployment, the session remains undefined.

## Problem
The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` to get the user session.  This works as expected locally. However, on Vercel, `session` is always null, resulting in an unauthorized error (401).

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Test the protected API route. The session should work.
5. Deploy to Vercel. Note that the session no longer works; it's undefined.

## Potential Causes
* **Incorrect Environment Variables:** There is a possibility that environmental variables, such as `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, are not properly configured in the Vercel deployment.
* **Caching:** Next.js's caching mechanisms may not be clearing properly, causing stale data to be served.
* **Vercel Configuration:** There might be some specific Vercel settings impacting the `unstable_getServerSession` function.
* **NextAuth configuration:** There is a possibility that there's an issue with how NextAuth is configured, that doesn't reveal itself until deployed to Vercel.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring the correct configuration of NextAuth.js and Vercel and carefully checking the environment variables.  See `bugSolution.js` for a possible fix involving explicit configuration and handling of environment variables.
